How to use:

The main code is the run_finfet.m code which is a Matlab script. This script uses SNM matlab script. The SNM script uses HSpice Toolbox for Matlab functions (Loadsig). You need to first download the HSpice toolbox for Matlab from the below link:

https://www.cppsim.com/download_hspice_tools.html
